# Object-Oriented Programming


[Object-Oriented Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) or OOP is a programming paradigm that focuses on the separation of code into components with well-established interfaces. This process of compartmentalization, of grouping together interrelated data and functionality, is found in all forms of programming, OOP merely emphasizes it.

### The Three Principles of OOP

- **Encapsulation**: objects should define a clear distinction between their public-facing and private-facing parts.

- **Inheritance**: object types should be re-usable and expanded upon

- **Polymorphism**: objects of a single interface can have different implementations
