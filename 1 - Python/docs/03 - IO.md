# Literals and I/O

There are two ways to put data into your program. One method is to write the data directly into the code with literals. Another way is to give your program some sort of I/O (Input / Output) so that it can retrieve and send out data on its own.

## Literals

The easiest way to enter data in your problem is through 'literals', which are called as such because they're *literally* written in the source code. All of the basic data types in python have a literal form, all of which allow you to enter values directly into your code. Literals for ints and floats are as simple as just typing in the number. Strings require single or double quotes to be by the interpreter recognized as a string instead of code. Things like lists and tuples are surrounds by brackets or parentheses and have commas inside them to separate the values. You can also use literals to create empty versions of some data types, like strings or lists.

- int literals: `3`, `-20`, `294927`

- float literals: `3.2`, `3.14e-10`

- bool literals: `True` and `False`

- string literals: `'hello'` and `"world"`
  Empty literal: `""` or `''`

- list literals: `[0, 2, 1, 2]`
  Empty literal: `[]`

- tuple literals: `(6, 4, 1, 4)`
  Empty literal: `()`

- dictionary literals `{'key:' 2, 'key_2': 5}`
  Empty literal: `{}`
    
- set literals `{2, 6, 9, 3}`

## I/O

### Print

The simplest form of output we have available is the print function.

Print is a function in python that allows us to print text to the terminal. Each call to `print` results in a new-line.

```python
print('hello')
print('world')
>>> hello
>>> world
```
You can specify a different terminating character, if you don't want it to print a new-line.

```python
print('hello', end=' ')
print('world')
>>> hello world
```

If you pass multiple arguments (separated by commas), it'll print them on a single line.
```python
print("Total score for", name, "is", score)
```

If you want to specify a different separator character (space is default), you can write something like:

```python
print("Total score for ", name, " is ", score, sep='')
```


### Input

The `input` function allows us to prompt the user for input on the terminal. The string that's passed to it determines what's displayed with the prompt.

```python
name = input('what is your name? ')
print('Hello', name, '!')
>>> what is your name? Joe
>>> Hello Joe!
```
