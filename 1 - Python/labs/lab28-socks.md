# Lab: Socks

You've just finished laundry and your expansive sock collection is in complete disorder. Sort your socks into pairs and pull out any loners.

1) Generate a list of 100 random socks, randomly chosen from a set of types: `sock_types = ['ankle', 'crew', 'calf', 'thigh']`

2) Find the number of duplicates and loners for each sock type. Hint: dictionaries are helpful here.


## Version 2

Now you have a mix of types **and** colors. Represent socks using tuples containing one color and one type `('black', 'crew')`. Randomly generate these, and then group them into pairs.

`sock_colors = ['black', 'white', 'blue']`
