# Lab 21: Peaks and Valleys

Define the following functions:

1. `peaks` - Returns the indices of peaks. A peak has a lower number on both the left and the right.

1. `valleys` - Returns the indices of 'valleys'. A valley is a number with a higher number on both the left and the right.

1. `peaks_and_valleys` - uses the above two functions to compile a single list of the peaks and valleys in order of appearance in the original data.

## Version 2 (optional)

Using the `data` list above, draw the image of `X`'s above.

## Version 3 (optional)

Imagine pouring water into onto these hills. The water would wash off the left and right sides, but would accumulate in the valleys. Below the water is represented by `O`'s. Given `data`, calculate the amount of water that would be collected.
