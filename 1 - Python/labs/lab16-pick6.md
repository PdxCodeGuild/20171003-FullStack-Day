# Lab 16: Pick6

Have the computer play pick6 many times and determine net balance.

Initially the program will pick 6 random numbers as the 'winner'. Then try playing powerball 100,000 times, with the ticket cost and payoff below.

A ticket contains 6 numbers, 1 to 99, and the number of matches between the ticket and the winning numbers determines the payoff. Calculate your net winnings (the sum of all expenses and earnings).

- the price of a ticket is $2
- if 1 number matches, you win $4
- if 2 numbers match, you win $7
- if 3 numbers match, you win $100
- if 4 numbers match, you win $50,000
- if 5 numbers match, you win #1,000,000
- if 6 numbers match, you win #25,000,000

## Version 2

The ROI (return on investment) is defined as `(earnings - expenses)/expenses`. Calculate your ROI, print it out along with your earnings and expenses.
