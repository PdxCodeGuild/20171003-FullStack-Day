# Lab 7: Password Generator

Let's generate a password of length `n` using a `while` loop and `random.choice`, this will be a string of random characters.

Hint: random.choice can be used to pick a character out of a string, as well as an element out of a list.

## Concepts Covered

- input, print
- looping
- random.choice
- the 'sting builder pattern'

## Version 2

Allow the user to enter the value of `n`, remember to convert its type, as `input` returns a string.
