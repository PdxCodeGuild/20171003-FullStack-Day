# Objects

Objects are composed of primitive types. They look like Python Dictionaries, but have attributes (variable names) instead of keys (strings).

```javascript
let library_user = {
    first_name: 'Jane',
    last_name: 'Smith',
    age: 20,
    books: [{
        title: 'A Wrinkle in Time',
        author: 'Madeleine L\'Engle',
        published: 1962
    },{
        title: 'The Giving Tree',
        author: 'Shel Silverstein',
        published: 1964
    }]
};
console.log(library_user.first_name); // Mike
console.log(library_user.books[0].title); // A Wrinkle in Time
```

You can also access the attributes of an object as you would a dictionary.

```javascript
