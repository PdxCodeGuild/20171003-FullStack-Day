# JavaScript Overview

JavaScript is a front-end language, written in `<script>` tags or in external `.js` files, and run by an interpreter in the browser. You can find more info in JavaScript [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide) and [here](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp). JavaScript, HTML, and CSS are the primary ingredients of every web page:

- HTML is the 'skeleton', the basic structure
- CSS controls the presentation and style
- JavaScript makes pages dynamic and interactive


JavaScript has become the de-factor standrard for front-end. There used to be Flash (which had a JavaScript-like language called ActionScript), Java Applets, and Microsoft's Silverlight. But with the development of stronger standards, browsers began dropping support for third-party plugins.

JavaScript is part of the 'C Family' of languages, those with syntax based on that of C: C++, Java, C#, Objective-C, Swift, Go, and [more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_C-family_programming_languages). You can find a brief account of the history of C Family languages [here](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/135544/why-are-several-popular-programming-languages-influenced-by-c). Familiarizing yourself with JavaScript syntax will enable you to more easily transition to these languages. That said, a thorough understanding of the principles underlying any one language will enable you to transition to any others. In JavaScript, most of the forms familiar to Python are there: numbers, strings, loops, classes, etc.

JavaScript (as its name implies) is a **scripting** language, meaning it was designed to be quick and ad-hoc. This worked well when pages were simple, but as web applications became more complex, its loose syntax became more of a hindrance. It is much easier to write messy code which is difficult to read and debug. Therefore it's important to impose upon yourself strict organization and 'best practices'.


## The Developer Console

Every major browser has a 'developer' panel which will show many things, including output and errors from JavaScript. In **Chrome** and **Internet Explorer** you can open this with **F12**. In **Firefox** you can open this with **Ctrl+Shift+K**.
