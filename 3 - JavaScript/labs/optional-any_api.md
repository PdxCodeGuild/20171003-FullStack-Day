Now's your chance to pick an API and build a page to view data retrieved from it. You can find some lists of public APIs [here](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis), [here](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?q=-aapi+api+OR++res_format%3Aapi#topic=developers_navigation), and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_open_APIs). Be warned: some have particular security restrictions, and some return results in XML (which makes data more difficult to parse). Below is a 'curated' list of APIs.


- Weather: [openweathermap.org](http://openweathermap.org/api)
