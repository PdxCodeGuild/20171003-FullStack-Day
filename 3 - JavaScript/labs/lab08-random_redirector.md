# Lab 8: Random Redirector

Create a page which randomly redirectly to another. Create an array of urls (as strings), and randomly pick one using `Math.random()`. Then redirect to the page using [window.location](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/location).


## Version 2

Using JavaScript's [timing events](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_timing.asp) show a 5-second countdown to the user. When the countdown is finished, redirect to a random page.
