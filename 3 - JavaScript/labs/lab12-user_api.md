# Lab 12: User API

Use the [reques.in](https://reqres.in/) API to show a list of users. The default view should be the first page of user: [example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PdxCodeGuild/PythonFullStack/master/3_JavaScript/resources/formatted-cards.png). If that API fails for some reason, you can also use [this one](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).

## Version 2

Show a list of pages at the bottom. If the user selects another page, show that page's list of users.

## Version 3 (optional)

If a user is selected, show a detailed view of that user, including all available information.
