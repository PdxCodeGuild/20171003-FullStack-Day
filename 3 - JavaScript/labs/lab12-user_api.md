# Lab 12: User API

Use the [reques.in](https://reqres.in/) API to show a list of users. The default view should be the first page of users with a list of pages at the bottom. If the user selects another page, show that page's list of users. [example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PdxCodeGuild/PythonFullStack/master/3_JavaScript/resources/formatted-cards.png).


# Advanced

If a user is selected, show a detailed view of that user, including their avatar.
