## Specific Past Capstones

### 20170626 Day Class

- Musilux: you can upload a midi file, the application will parse it and begin playing the notes (audio) while displaying the notes played on a keyboard.


### 20170724 Night class

- Brain Exchange: a site which matches teachers and students. When users register on the site, they list which skills they know (and are willing to teach) and which skills they want to learn. After registering, the user is matched up with those who can teach what they want to learn, and learn what they want to teach.

- Visualize Food Access By County: a site which uses d3.js to visualize food access with a choropleth map. It loads an XLSX from [the Food Environment Atlas from the USDA Economic Research Service](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-environment-atlas/data-access-and-documentation-downloads/) into a database. The front page then loads the data from the database via AJAX and uses it to populate the map. The front page has a drop-down to select which variable to visualize. There's another page to visualize the correlation matrix between the various variables, and another to see a scatter plot between two selected variables.

- Space Explorer: a game in d3.js like Flappy Bird, except you're an astronaut dodging asteroids and collecting space crystals. The user enters their name at the start, and when they finish, their score is entered into a table of high scores.
