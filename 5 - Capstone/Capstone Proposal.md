# Capstone Proposal

The Capstone is a web application that touches on every major technology we covered: Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Django. Below are the criteria for your proposal. It's difficult to be certain how long each feature will take to develop. Therefore you should plan out multiple 'milestones' for your project. That way, if you reach milestone 2 but not 3, you still have something worthwhile to present and be proud of. It also gives you the opportunity to plan out what you'd like to work on after the class is finished. I can help you sculpt out an idea, and I'll tell you very plainly whether a goal is attainable given our time constraints. I highly recommend doing some sketches of pages. This document is for you as much as it is for me. By planning thoroughly and precisely, the implementation will be much easier. Your proposal is due by the time we start our capstones (3-4 weeks before the end of the course).

- Your proposal must be in a markdown `.md` file [more info](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/)
- Your proposal must set specific and attainable goals
- Your proposal must cover all major topics we've covered
- Your proposal must include the sections below



## Name

Give your project a cool name. I recommend going to [translate.google.com](https://translate.google.com/), picking a random language, and typing in random words. Or there's [behindthename.com](https://www.behindthename.com/).

## Project Overview

What are the major features of your web application? What problem is it attempting to solve? What libraries or frameworks will you use?

## Functionality

Walk through the application from the user's perspective. What will they see on each page? What can they input and click and see? How will their actions correspond to events on the back-end?

## Data Model

What data will you need to store as part of your application? These should be specific nouns, collections of information that serve a collective purpose. Examples might be 'User', 'Book', 'ImageSet'.

## Schedule

Here you'll want to come up with some (very rough) estimates of the timeframe for each section. State specifically which steps you'll take in the implementation. This section should also include work you're planning to do after the capstone is finished.
