# Post-Course Work

**Your learning should not end once the class is over!**
You have learned the basics, but continuing your education is necessary to become more competitive in the job market.
The first _two years_ of being a junior web developer will be as fast-paced as this class was.

Find ways to keep educating yourself.

* Do more independent work on your capstone
* Attend coding meet-ups
* Contribute to an open source project
* Use coding to solve small day-to-day problems
* Start another large project

Use those "excuses" learn more technical skills.

* Different web frameworks and lanagugaes (Java / Dropwizard, Ruby / Rails, etc.)
* Unit, integration, contract testing
* Advanced Git
* Systems programming (C, C++, Rust, Go, etc.)
* Data analysis (R, Pandas, NumPy, Matlab, etc.)
* Distributed data processing (Hadoop, Kafka, Storm, etc.)
* Front-end frameworks (AngularJS, React, etc.)
* Shell scripting, administration, and advanced command line tools (bash, grep, sed, etc.)
* Mobile development (iOS: Swift, Objective-C, Android: Java, etc.)
* Database types and interfaces (SQL, NoSQL, Elasticsearch, Cassandra, etc.)
* Game programming (C, C++, D, OpenGL, etc.)
* Service oriented architectures (Docker, Kubernetes, Zipkin, etc.)
* Security techniques

As a graduate of Code Guild, you are welcome to:

* Email Instructors
* Use the public Code Guild facilities as a workspace
* Come to our demo days and public code meet-ups ([Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Portland-Programmer-Network/) and [Calagator](http://calagator.org))
