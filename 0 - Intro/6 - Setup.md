## Setup Checklist

- Create a Slack account (I'll send you an invite)
- Install Git
- Create GitHub account and a new repository
- Install Anaconda or Python
- Install an IDE or other text editor


## Slack

Please send an email to `matthew@pdxcodeguild.com`, so I have your email address. I'll then send you an invitation to Slack, which is an instant-messaging app we'll use to communicate. You can install the Slack desktop app rather than use a browser tab if that's easier for you.



## Version Control: Git & GitHub


[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) is a popular VCS (version control system) we'll use in conjunction with [GitHub](https://github.com/). This will help us keep track of our source code, and give us a public place to show our work to others, like a programming portfolio. A repository is a collection of folders and files. GitHub hosts a copy of those files, and Git allows us to keep our local and remote repository synchronized.

Download and install Git and create a GitHub account. In GitHub, create a new repository to hold your files for the files you'll create in class.


## Python and Anaconda

#### Anaconda

[Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) contains the python interpreter and many other packages we'll be using, including Jupyter Notebook.


#### Python and Pip

If you don't want to use Anaconda, you can [install python directly](https://www.python.org/downloads/). `Pip` is the package manager for python. Always start by updating pip itself, `pip3 install --upgrade pip`, Then you can install packages by running commands such as `pip3 install jupyter`.



## Text Editors and IDEs

You can use any text editor for writing source code, but some text editors have features specifically for programming. These are called IDEs: Integrated Development Environments. Below are some common features of IDEs:

- Syntax Highlighting
- Refactoring
- Testing & Debugging
- Version Control
- Deployment

The more features a program has, the more cluttered its interface will be, the longer it'll take to open and close, etc. Many people prefer using a more 'lightweight' text editor, and then executing their python in a terminal by typing `python source_file.py`.
